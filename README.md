去掉沙发转角两个位置，重新按产品的外观材质生成一个直排三人位的沙发。
Photorealistic furniture photography of a straight three-seater recliner sofa, modeled after the CHEERS 55153 design. The sofa is upholstered in high-quality heathered grey woven fabric with a rich tactile texture and visible coarse grain. The structure features three distinct seating segments, each with a plush, ergonomic backrest divided by horizontal lumbar seams for optimal support. The two outer ends are finished with thick, elegantly curved padded armrests. Professional studio lighting highlights the intricate weave of the upholstery and the soft contours of the cushioning. Minimalist composition, clean white studio background, 8k resolution, hyper-realistic details, sharp focus on fabric texture, high-end interior design aesthetic.
